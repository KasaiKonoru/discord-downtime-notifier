# Discord Downtime Notifier Bot
This is a small bot that notifies a server through a message when another bot goes offline. The main use is to let users know when a music bot goes offline and becomes unusable. It also lets users know once said bot goes back online. This is useful mostly for server owners with self-hosted bots and need a way of getting notified when they bots go offline. For better results, this bot should be hosted on a service like [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).

## To Do:
* This bot should work for multiple servers and multiple bots inside each server.
* If possible, server ID shouldn't be required by the user.
* It would also be interesting if the bot could also mention for how long has the specified bot been down.
* I also need to write a little guide on how to use this bot on this readme.
